JitCalc
=======

A small program demonstrating how to use [AsmJit](http://code.google.com/p/asmjit/) to create a just-in-time mathematical expression evaluator.

The objectives are to demonstrate how to use AsmJit (right now there are few examples online) and to demonstrate how much faster JIT code generation can be.

Compiling
---------

This project uses a CMake build. You'll need a recent version of GCC orclang (C++11 features used heavily). Tested on x86-64 Linux only. I'd expect x86-64 OSX to work too.

Usage
-----

Examples soon.

Benchmark Results
-----------------

Coming soon.
